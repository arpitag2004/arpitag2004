### Featured Project: Predicting National Happiness from Socioeconomic Indicators
My machine learning project where I built and compared models to predict happiness levels of countries using data from the World Happiness Report.

Tools: Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow (Keras), Matplotlib, Pandas
What I Did: Cleaned and analyzed socioeconomic data (GDP, health, freedom, etc.), engineered binary labels from life satisfaction scores, and trained both a Logistic Regression model and a Neural Network classifier.
Results:
    - Both models achieved 88â€“89% accuracy and ROC-AUC scores above 0.95
    - Logistic Regression offered strong performance with interpretability
    - Neural Network captured subtle nonlinear patterns and generalized well without overfitting
    - Final models revealed that GDP, social support, and health were the strongest indicators of national happiness
